``Musts:``

* See and transfer to-dos from ``main.ts``
* Turn ``StrictNullChecks`` on
* Write geometry loader. Add new geometry folder in assets where each file is a separate geometry i.e. plane.ts create and returns a 1x1 plane
* Hard code a sprite mesh into the resource loader and have sprites transform that to prevent recreating a new sprite mesh every time we need a new sprite
* Remove hurtBox code in lieu of hitBox changes
* Update three.js
* Add gyroscopes
* Add screen shake method back to game state
* Set up Behavior generator type
* Set up ``archetypes`` directory to output pre-constructed entities
* Set up lose state
* Create loading bar. Might need to set up canvas prior to everything else to render loading bar
* Set up event listeners specific to each state. Remove events of previous state before setting them up.
    > Add ``activateEvents`` and ``deactivateEvents`` abstract methods on ``baseState``. Override ``push`` and ``pop`` methods of ``stateStack`` to call these new methods

``Maybes:``
* Write script to export project to electron using ``electron-builder``
    > Electron will now use ``dist`` folder. Web build will now use ``www`` folder
* Create skeletal animation data interpreter system that takes skeletal anim data from a program like blender and applies it to specified assets. State machine for animation data. Look into using three.js' animation layer
* Name framework pieces of Boardhouse library in a type definition file
* Add library as an npm package
    > search-engine "npm publishing typescript"
* Before this can be done, we must package and pull the existing library locally
    > This will require distinguishing between current framework code and engine code. Library can be part application (see ``ui`` in ``src``) and part engine (see ``basestate.ts``)
* Example tsconfig.json:
    ```json
    "boardhouse-pure-browser": {
        "front-end": "../src/app",
        "back-end": "../src/framework"
    },
    "boardhouse-full-stack": {
        "front-end": "../src/app",
        "middleware": "../src/node",
        "back-end": "../src/framework"
    }

    // Search engine: "typescript module resolution"
``Finished``
* :heavy_check_mark: ``NoImplicitAny`` true
* :heavy_check_mark: Move new collision stuff over
* :heavy_check_mark: Define interface for system function
* :heavy_check_mark: Component design for ``<root />`` element so global UI state can be passed from the game state and filter down to all UI components.
    > See current parent -> child passing usage with state
* :heavy_check_mark: Update ``removeChild()`` method on ``Widget`` class so UI can be hidden and/or deleted. Use empty three JS methods for both text and sprite properties.
* :heavy_check_mark: update TypeScript compiler
